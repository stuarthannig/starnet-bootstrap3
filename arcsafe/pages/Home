<p>
  The ArcSafe&#174; Pump Control Center is available as a standalone unit to be installed in an existing structure or as an integrated unit with Arrow prefabricated “walk-in” stations. Our unique design makes it easier to comply with electrical safety regulations (CFR 1910 Subpart S) and standards (NFPA 70E). The compartmentalization of the ArcSafe&#174; panel keeps line voltage away from anyone who may need to get into cabinets.
