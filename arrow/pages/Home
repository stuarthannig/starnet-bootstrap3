  Our unique designs eliminate many safety hazards such as confined space, fall hazards and weather related dangers. Our control panel design greatly simplifies compliance with electrical safety regulations (CFR 1910 Subpart S) and standards (NFPA 70E). The compartmentalization of the ArcSafe&#174; panel keeps line voltage away from anyone who may need to get into cabinets. The building, arrives assembled, with control components and wiring pre-installed.
